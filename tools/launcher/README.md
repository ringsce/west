THE AS OF YET NOT OFFICIALLY NAMED LAUNCHER FOR EKRON
====================================================

The launcher for Ekron RPG. Built with QT, written in C++. 

This project's goal as an updater is to get everyone on OS X, and Linux (arm64) onto modern versions of Ekron RPG, and keep them up-to-date in a style similar to other stand-alone launcher/updater systems for games that aren't on major digital-distribution platforms.

As a launcher this project should enable easy access to Ekron RPG  features that are otherwise buried in wikis, forums, and README files.

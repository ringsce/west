# Ekron Wars Documentation

Welcome to the Ekorn Wars documentation. Here is documented how
Wars is installed and configured. Please make sure to read
through the whole guide before asking questions!

Some general hints:

* No matter what's the current keyboard layout or on which platform the
  game is running, the console is always opened and closed by pressing
  **Left Shift + Escape**.
* Ekron Wars saves its configuration, savegames and screenshots to
  *~/.ew* (unixoid platforms) or *My Documents\ew* (Windows).
  If Ekron Wars is started with the `-portable` switch all data is
  saved in the same directory as the executables.

The documentation is split into several documents:

* [Index File](01_index.md)
* [Installation Guide](02_installation.md)
* [Configuration Guide](03_configuration.md)
* [List Of All New Console Variables](04_cvarlist.md)
* [Packaging Guide For Maintainers](05_packaging.md)
* [Contributing Guide](06_contributing.md)
* [Multiplayer Server Configuration](07_multiplayer.md)
* [File Listings](08_filelists.md)

#  ringsce editor
This is an editor written with Lazarus IDE and free Pascal. Where you can use for ringsce repo to build the engine
ringsCE editor is available too for silicon compatibility mode. For, this build its' a gtk3 editor and interpreter.
We are coding a vm and interpreter for editor, macros and gaming script. For older versions like intel os'es we must use freePascal instead.
For silicon compatibility mode we need to use gtk3 editor and gtk3 framework from brew.

## Our Goals
Our goal for this project is to deliver an open-source library for JSON, XML, and database for the ringsCE engine.
To get started, we need to have now a m1+ for building our own json library and XML library. For older versions we must use the freePascal code folder.

## Database goals

Our database goals are to achieve a library capable of working with JSON and XML.

### v1 updated version
it's compatible with Lazarus-ide version 3. Already done the change.

## Parser and reader
Here, we will find a parser and a reader for processing the data inside the openkrown data file folder. This library will be inside the data-dir folder. With this parser, we can manipulate the data from the zip content folder.

## Documentation
To build this project, we must use brew install, freePascal, gtk3 and vs code package editor.

brew install gtk+3
